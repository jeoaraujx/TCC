Para a especificação, desenvolvimento e testes da solução foram aplicados o método de pesquisa experimental com um percurso metodológico de seis etapas alinhadas ao processo de desenvolvimento de produto (PDP). Esta pesquisa traz uma análise comparativa da solução proposta com ferramentas correlatas de mercado tais como: Escavador, Chrome Qualis, Guia Especialista, Somos UFMG, Stela Experta e Plataforma Integra. Como resultado este projeto gerou uma arquitetura da solução e a sua materialização em um portal, trazendo uma série de funcionalidades úteis para pesquisadores, instituições acadêmicas e outros interessados na busca de informações nesse campo.&amp;lt;/p&amp;gt;},
